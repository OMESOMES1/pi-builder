# "virtual-pi"

## Project scope

Development of a reproducible “build” process for converting official Raspbian SD card
images to an image which, when flashed to an SD card and used with a Raspberry Pi Zero W,
can produce a WiFi hotspot for easy use. Optional follow-up goals (only if time remains) in this
contract include additionally simultaneously connecting the Raspberry Pi to another WiFi
network for internet access during use, and a “captive portal” setup to direct users to the correct
URL to view images.

## Project parts

 - [x] Research reproducible build method
 - [ ] Setup automated build process
 - [ ] Include desired packages
 - [ ] Convert hostapd configuration.

## Strech goals

 - [ ] Simultaneous client wifi
 - [ ] Captive portal to images (and wifi config)
